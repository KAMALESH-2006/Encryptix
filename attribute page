            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law in London and later worked in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics, and leadership skills. Returning to India, he led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</p>
            <p>In 1915, Gandhi returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress. His philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, became the foundation of the Indian independence movement. One of his most notable campaigns was the Salt March in 1930, a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt production and sales.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life, Gandhi advocated for civil rights and freedoms. His commitment to nonviolence and his ability to inspire millions of people earned him the title of 'Mahatma,' meaning 'Great Soul.' Gandhi's efforts culminated in India's independence on August 15, 1947. Tragically, he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy continues to inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
